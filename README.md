### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Juraj, a full-stack software engineer with 5 years of experience.

For the past 3.5 years at Owlin, I've been building a big data architecture at the intersection of risk, finance, and news. Owlin's clients include Nike, KPMG, Fitch Ratings, ING and several large investment firms.

I hack in my free time. Take a look at *rides*, my full-stack simulation of a ride-hailing app. I also write about the journey of building it on my blog.

I work mainly with JavaScript (Node.js, TypeScript) and Go. I know my way around React, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, ElasticSearch, Docker and Git.

I'm open to job opportunities starting in August/September this year.
